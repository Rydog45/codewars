// You are given an array of numbers in string form. Your task is to convert this to an array of numbers.

// Your function can only be a maximum of 30 characters long (not including whitespaces)! I have limited the char count because there is a very short and easy way to achieve this task.

let convert = a => a.map(Math.abs);
